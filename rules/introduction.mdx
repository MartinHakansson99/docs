## Rules Engine

Our powerful rules engine allows you to manipulate your product data in countless ways. You can create simple or complex rules to transform, filter, and enrich your data before it is sent to different channels.

### How Rules Work

The rules engine processes a set of instructions you define. Each rule consists of one or more conditions (`if`, `and`, `or`) and a set of actions (`then`). You can also specify actions to be performed if the conditions are not met (`else`).

- **Conditions**: These are checks that are performed on your data. For example, you can check if a product title contains a certain word, or if its price is above a specific value.
- **Actions**: If the conditions are met, the actions are executed. Actions can modify your data, such as replacing text, performing calculations, or even excluding a product entirely.

### Rule Structure

A typical rule has the following structure:

- **IF** a condition is true
- **AND** another condition is true (optional)
- **OR** another condition is true (optional)
- **THEN** perform an action
- **ELSE** perform another action (optional)

This structure allows for building very flexible and powerful data transformations.
